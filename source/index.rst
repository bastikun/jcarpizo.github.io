The Tao of Programming
======================

**The Silent Void**

*"When you have learned to snatch the error code from the trap frame, it will be time for you to leave."*

**The Ancient Masters**

*"After three days without programming, life becomes meaningless."*

**Design**

*"When a program is being tested, it is too late to make design changes."*

**Coding**

*"A well-written program is its own Heaven; a poorly-written program is its own Hell."*

**Maintenance** :

*"Though a program be but three lines long, someday it will have to be maintained."*

**Management**

*"Let the programmers be many and the managers few -- then all will be productive."*

**Corporate Wisdom**

*"You can demonstrate a program for a corporate executive, but you can't make him computer literate."*

**Hardware and Software**

*"Without the wind, the grass does not move. Without software hardware is useless."*

**Epilogue**

*"Time for you to leave."*
